// At first, John reaches alpha and stores values of starting index which is zero // this happens only once in the beginning
// then John reaches beta and checks whether the given condition
// given by beta is true or not,

// given condition by beta is true ==>
// John runs the code inside the bracket, and after running the code of bracket, John reaches to gama and
// increment its value by one then again john checks the condition at beta and the cycle continues
// till the beta condition becomes false

// else false,==> john comes of the bracket
